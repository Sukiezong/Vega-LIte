# Templates for making correct graphs with Vega-Lite
Development of a set of graphical drawing templates for graphics commonly used in academic research papers using the visualisation tool Vega-Lite

VSCode vs Vega-Lite Online Editor

# Data set
Since the charts I quoted are all derived from published NLP papers, I cannot directly obtain the original data in the experiment. However, some of the charts provide data. For the charts that do not provide specific data, I will roughly restore them based on the content of the chart. Vega-Lite supports CSV and JSON formats, and the data I use throughout the project is stored in a unified CSV format.
